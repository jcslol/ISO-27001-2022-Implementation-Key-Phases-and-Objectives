# PDCA Cycle (fundamental framework in ISO 27001)
This repository provides a brief guide to understanding the PDCA Cycle for implementing an Information Security Management System (ISMS) in compliance with ISO 27001. It covers the key phases, objectives, and core changes from ISO 27001:2017 to ISO 27001:2022.

# Overview of the PDCA Cycle
The Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle is a fundamental framework for implementing and continually improving ISMS under ISO 27001:2022.

Plan Phase:	Identify scope, gain management support, conduct risk assessment, define SoA are Key Activities.
Do	Phase: Implement controls, conduct training, and operate the ISMS are Key Activities.
Check	Phase: Monitor the ISMS, conduct internal audits, and review performance are Key Activities.
Act	Phase: Take corrective actions, drive continuous improvement, and address non-conformities are Key Activities.

**Plan Phase**
Gain Management Support: Demonstrate ROI, highlight key risks, and propose an implementation plan.
Define the Scope: Locations, units, processes, assets, networks; specify in-scope and out-of-scope areas.
Conduct Risk Assessment:Three different types of Risk Assesment are,
Asset-Based: Identify assets, threats, and vulnerabilities.
Event-Based: Analyze risks from past security events.
Threat-Based: Identify IT system vulnerabilities and apply controls.

**DO Phase**
Metrics: Track KPIs like incident resolution rate and training completion.
Implement Controls: Deploy MFA, encryption, and backups.
Training: Conduct phishing simulations and security workshops.
Operate ISMS: Monitor logs, test response plans, and ensure regular backups.

**CHECK Phase**
Monitor Performance: Assess ISMS effectiveness and identify issues.
Internal Audits: Evaluate compliance with ISO 27001 controls.
Document Review: Note non-conformities and prepare for improvement.
Management Review: Analyze results, assess effectiveness, and address improvements.

**ACT Phase**
Corrective Actions: Address non-conformities, document fixes, and verify results.
Continuous Improvement: Optimize ISMS, monitor feedback, and identify new risks.

# ISO 27001:2022 vs ISO 27001:2017
Annex A Controls: Reduced from 114 to 93 controls.Grouped into 4 main themes. Those are,
A.5: Organizational Controls
A.6: People Controls
A.7: Physical Controls
A.8: Technological Controls

New Controls Added: Address modern threats and technologies.
5.23: Information Security for Cloud Services
5.30: ICT Readiness for Business Continuity
5.7: Threat Intelligence
Alignment with ISO 27002:2022: Reflects updated guidance on implementing controls.
